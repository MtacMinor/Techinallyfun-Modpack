##Techinallyfun-Modpack

Techinallyfun is a modpack that was made by my old friend. (God Rest His Soul) Techinallyfun is the a modpack that he would of been proud of.
TechnicallyFun is also the work of 2 people Mtac and Laloth. Laloth last year died so I have had to take over the pack. I hope you enjoy TechnicallyFun as much as I had fun making it! If you fined a problem just tweet me @mtac002
